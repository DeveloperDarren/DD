  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a 12 year old boy in Year 7 with a genuine passion for technology, digital arts and video games.
    I aspire to be a developer at Logitech, Razer or Apple. I'm also decent at photoshop and use my digital
    art skills to create things as a side hobby. The amount of time and effort i put into video games is 
    insane, i've met so many friends online and we all have learnt about many valuable skills that we can
    use IRL.
